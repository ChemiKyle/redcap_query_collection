# REDCap project deletion history on the CTSI REDCap instance

This reports summarizes REDCap project deletion activity on the CTSI REDCap instance. The hope is that the metrics and visualizatons presented here can show how policy changes on this REDCap instance influence the use of the system.

```{r deletion_by_time, include=FALSE}
# Select only permanent deletions group by event_date and plot result
perm_deletions_by_month <- del_events %>% 
  filter(description == "Permanently delete project") %>%
  select(project_id, event_date) %>%
  group_by(month = floor_date(event_date, "month")) %>%
  summarise(deletions = n())
```

```{r plot_deletion_by_time, echo=FALSE}
# Plot the size of deletion activity over time
ggplot(data=perm_deletions_by_month, aes(x=month, y=deletions))  +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("Count") + 
  xlab("Month") +
  scale_x_date() +
  ggtitle("Project deletions by month")
```

```{r deletion_by_time_detail, include=FALSE}
# Show the detail of deletion activity since the policy announcement
perm_deletions_by_week <- del_events %>% 
  filter(description == "Permanently delete project") %>%
  select(project_id, event_date) %>%
  filter(event_date >= ymd("2018-05-15")) %>%
  group_by(week = floor_date(event_date, "week")) %>%
  summarise(deletions = n())
```

```{r plot_deletion_by_time_detail, echo=FALSE}
# Plot the size of deletion activity over time
ggplot(data=perm_deletions_by_week, aes(x=week, y=deletions))  +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("Count") +
